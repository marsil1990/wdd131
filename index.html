            <img class="my-image" src="images/marcos.jpg" alt="Photo of Marcos Silvera">
            <p>My name is Marcos Silvera, and I live in Uruguay with my wife. I have been working as a high
                school math
                teacher since 2017, and I truly enjoy helping my students grow and understand the world through
                mathematics. I'm currently studying software development through BYU-Pathway Worldwide, and I love
                learning new technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C#. My goal is to combine
                education and technology to create tools that make learning more dynamic and accessible.</p>

                    Uruguay is a small but beautiful country located in South America, bordered by
                    Argentina and Brazil. It is known for its peaceful society, quality of life, and strong democratic
                    traditions. Uruguay has a rich culture influenced by European immigration, and it is famous for its
                    beaches, mate (a traditional herbal drink), tango music, and passionate football fans. The capital
                    city, Montevideo, offers a mix of colonial architecture, a vibrant coastline, and modern urban life.
