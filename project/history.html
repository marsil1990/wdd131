                    <p>
                        On May 14, 1899, 22 young men aged between 13 and 20 gathered at Ernesto Caprario's house to
                        found Club Nacional de Football—the first creole club in the Americas and the oldest football
                        club in Uruguay. During the founding session, they established the club's principles, name, and
                        kit. Sebastián Puppo was elected as President, and Domingo Prat as Captain.

                        On June 25, 1899, Nacional defeated Uruguay Athletic's second team 2-0 in Punta Carretas, on a
                        field loaned to them by Juan Cat, Manager of the Sociedad Comercial de Montevideo. Melitón
                        Romero scored the first-ever goal in Nacional's history, followed by Juan Carlos Vallarino.

                    <p>
                        Miguel Prudencio Reyes, who handled equipment and inflated the balls, cheered Nacional loudly
                        from the sidelines. His constant encouragement during games led spectators to ask, “Who is
                        that?” — “That's the fan... the ball inflator of Nacional.” The word *hincha* (fan) was born at
                        Club Nacional de Football.

                        On May 27, 1900, Nacional played its first match at the newly inaugurated Gran Parque Central
                        against Deutscher F.K. Located on the historic grounds of the “Quinta de la Paraguaya,” where
                        José Artigas was proclaimed leader of the Orientals in 1811, the stadium became Nacional’s home.
                        It is the oldest stadium in the Americas and the 16th oldest in the world.

                        On March 24, 1902, Miguel Nebel proposed replacing the red and blue shirt with a white one—a
                        motion that was approved. On May 23, the club's official flag was created. Domingo Prat
                        suggested the colors blue, white, and deep red. Ernesto Caprario presented a sketch: a blue flag
                        with a white diagonal stripe and the red inscription “C. N. de F.”
