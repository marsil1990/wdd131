            <p>
                Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto
                men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy
                thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;

                Alma 12:7
            </h2>
            <p>
                Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced
                more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of
                him, for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto
                them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.
